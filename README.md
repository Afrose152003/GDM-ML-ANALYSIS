# GDM-ML-ANALYSIS
This project identifies key variables for predicting GDM and evaluates predictive algorithms. Using Python in Google Colab, the Kaggle GDM dataset was preprocessed, with PCA applied to find influential variables. AutoML with PyCaret determined the best models, highlighting AdaBoost and LightGBM, visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
